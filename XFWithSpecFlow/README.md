# XAMVVM-03 SpecFlow with Xamarin.Forms!

Let’s explore the possibilities of the awesome SpecFlow Behavior Driven Testing Framework with Xamarin.Forms! 
Typical UnitTesting doesn’t really make much of a sense to a non-technical person, since its all code and logic based and the out put is not really human friendly (for a non techie). This is where Behavior Driven Development comes into play, it defines a common ground that can be shared among all the stakeholders that are involved in a development of a software, from a techie to a non-techie, from Developers, Testers, QA Engineers, to Business Analysts and even directly to the Customer.

BDD tests are written in a way that it is easily understood by everyone, even before the development life cycle begins, while making sure the requirements are specific and well defined.
 
Now in order to actually implement these BDD Tests using Gherkin syntaxes, we used a framework called Cucumber, which is a Ruby based framework! But when it comes to .NET we have an awesome wrapper framework for Cucumber called SpecFlow, that provides us with all the goodness of BDD Testing.
Since SpecFlow bring the beauty of Gherkin-BDD  goodness to .NET we can directly use it in our Xamarin.Forms project solution as well any .NET project solution.
